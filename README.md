## 🚀 How It Works

1.  ➡️ **Pick a Lab:** Choose from our library of real-world projects, from building a GenAI Chatbot to fixing a broken cloud network.
2.  📦 **Launch Your Sandbox:** We instantly provision a **real, dedicated** AWS, Azure, or GCP account for you.
3.  🛠️ **Build, Break, & Fix:** Use your repo and the real cloud console to deploy the app, debug real-world errors, and learn by doing.
4.  🏆 **Build Your Portfolio:** You've just built a project that *proves* you're job-ready.
